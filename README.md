## Project Overview

This TYPO3 project aims to [brief project description, e.g., "deliver a high-performance, scalable website for our client."] It includes custom extensions, integrations with third-party services, and follows TYPO3 coding standards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Typo3 v.12.4.x
- PHP v.8.1.29
- Composer v.X.X.X
- MySQL or MariaDB (Client API header version: 10.6.18-MariaDB)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bais92/eea_components.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
4. Set up the database and configure your `.env` file accordingly.

5. Run the TYPO3 setup wizard by accessing `/typo3/install.php` in your browser.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the TYPO3 coding standards.
- Ensure that all custom extensions are placed in `typo3conf/ext/`.
- All configurations should be managed via site packages and TypoScript.

## Testing

### Running Tests

- Unit tests are written using PHPUnit and are located in the `Tests/` directory of each extension.
- Run tests using the following command:
    ```bash
    composer test
    ```
- Ensure all tests pass before committing any code.

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high code coverage for all critical functionalities.
- Generate test coverage reports with:
    ```bash
    composer coverage
    ```

## Conventional Commits

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. This is essential to ensure consistent commit history and helps in automating the release process.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should have the following format:

<type>(<scope>): <subject>


#### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Examples:

- `feat(homepage): add carousel for featured content`
- `fix(contact-form): correct email validation`
